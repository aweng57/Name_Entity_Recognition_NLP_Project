# Name_Entity_Recognition_NLP_Project


### PROJECT GOAL
This project is focused on implementing a Name Entity Recognition (NER) model for natural language processing (NLP). The goal of this project is to create a model that can recognize and label specific entities such as names, locations, and organizations within a given text.

## EDA 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the nature and structure of the data used in the project. The data consisted of a set of labeled sentences that were used to train the NER model. The sentences were taken from a variety of sources, including news articles, blogs, and social media posts. The EDA helped to identify the most common entities in the data, as well as any potential issues or anomalies.

## PROCESS
The process of building the NER model involved several key steps. First, the data was preprocessed and cleaned to remove any unwanted characters or formatting. Next, a machine learning algorithm, specifically a Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model, was trained on the preprocessed data. The model was trained using the Tensorflow library and the Keras API.

After training, the model was tested on a separate set of validation data to evaluate its accuracy and performance. The results of the model were analyzed to determine its overall effectiveness at recognizing and labeling entities within text.

## RESULT
Overall, the results of the project were successful in creating an effective NER model that was able to accurately identify and label entities within a given text. The model achieved a high level of accuracy, and its performance was comparable to other state-of-the-art NER models. The project demonstrates the potential of NER models for a variety of NLP tasks, including text classification and sentiment analysis.
